# cuddly-octo-funicular
Spam email classifier based on Naive Bayes theorem, using NLTK and SciKit-Learn (repo named by GitHub).
 - The training data for this classifier came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/balakishan77/spam-or-ham-email-classification/data).
 - The data file has been added in this repo as `emails.csv`
 - The python script file has been added as `model.py`
 - A jupyter notebook of the script (with exactly same contents) has been added as `model.ipynb` (See? I didn't even change the name of the file)
 - The algorithm dump of the classifier model, generated using _pickle_, has been added (in case you don't have time to run the training yourself) as `final_model.sav` (See [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-machine-learning-models-python-scikit-learn/) in case you ain't sure about how to use this file).
